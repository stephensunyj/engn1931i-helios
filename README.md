# ENGN 1931I Final Project - Helios
### Helios - The Integrated, Inexpensive Smart Shade & Alarm System

Ever felt tired reaching for your blinds every day? Ever wanted to wake up to natural light? Helios is the product for you! Helios is a  set of smart window blinds that can raise, lower and rotate through voice commands. It also comes with a separate unconnected alarm clock unit, that when ringing, will also automatically raise the blinds to wake the user up through natural light. 

We used stepper motors and 2 Arduino Unos to control the blinds and alarm clock respectively, and a HC12 wireless chip to communicate wirelessly between the blinds and alarm clock. BitVoicer was used for the voice communication functionality.
